Linux installation:
-------------------

1/ extract to somewhere, like /home/dfp/eep
2/ make the controller executable: chmod +x eep.php
3/ create a globally available link, like,
su
cd /usr/bin
ln -s -T /home/dfp/eep/eep.php eep
4/ edit eepSetting.php to update the path to the cache file to somewhere that is writable on your system, like /var/tmp/

Command line completion:
------------------------

On linuxes you can set up bash completion (which is highly convenient) by:
sudo ln -s /home/dfp/eep/bash_completion/eep /etc/bash_completion.d/eep

Note that on CentOS, you might have to:
sudo yum install bash-completion

In order to insert the eep commandline completion script into the current bash
session, you have to either:
. /etc/bash_completion
or start a new shell (like on CentOS)

OS X installation:
------------------

Manual:
1/ sudo mdkir /etc/bash_completion.d
2/ sudo ln -s /your_path_to_eep/bash_completion/eep /etc/bash_completion.d/eep

Then add the following to your ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc etc. 
for f in /etc/bash_completion.d/*; do source $f; done

Any file in that location will now be sourced for bash use
Start a new shell

Via Homebrew / Mac Ports:
See http://superuser.com/questions/288438/bash-completion-for-commands-in-mac-os

Then create the symbolic link to /your_path_to_eep/bash_completion/eep in the installation specific completion folder
Start a new shell

Windows installation:
---------------------

1/ extract to somewhere, like C:\wamp\scripts\eep
2/ make the controller executable: icacls C:\wamp\scripts\eep\eep.php /T /Q /C /RESET
3/ create a globally available link by adding eep.php to the PATH variable

Installation note:
------------------

you can override the settings by copying
.../eep/eepSettings.php
into your home folder and editing it. You may have to keep it uptodate
with new versions, as these settings change.
