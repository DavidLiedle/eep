Linux installation:
-------------------

1/ extract to somewhere, like /home/dfp/eep
2/ make the controller executable: chmod +x eep.php
3/ create a globally available link, like,
su
cd /usr/bin
ln -s -T /home/dfp/eep/eep.php eep

Command line completion:
------------------------

On linuxes you can set up bash completion (which is highly convenient) by:
sudo ln -s /home/dfp/eep/bash_completion/eep /etc/bash_completion.d/eep

Windows installation:
---------------------

1/ extract to somewhere, like C:\wamp\scripts\eep
2/ make the controller executable: icacls C:\wamp\scripts\eep\eep.php /T /Q /C /RESET
3/ create a globally available link by adding eep.php to the PATH variable

Installation note:
------------------

you can override the settings by copying
.../eep/eepSettings.php
into your home folder and editing it. You may have to keep it uptodate
with new versions, as these settings change.
